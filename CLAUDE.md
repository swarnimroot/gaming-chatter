# gaming-chatter — instructions for Claude

Personal gaming-news aggregator. Daily ingest from 15 news sites + 10 subreddits + 6 YouTube channels → Monday-morning weekly exec summary + live dashboard. Local-only, single user.

## Status
Design phase. No code yet. UI template pending external delivery from claude.ai/design.

## Read first
- `docs/PRD.md` — what we're building and why
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — how it works
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — locked choices + rationale
- `docs/TASKS.md` — phased build plan + status
- `docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` — unresolved items
- `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` — prior-session handoff notes

## Hard architectural constraints — do not violate without explicit approval

- **Single Python process.** FastAPI + APScheduler + scrapers-lib + Ollama HTTP + Anthropic SDK in one app. Do not introduce a worker queue, separate scheduler service, Docker container, or split process model.
- **SQLite single-file storage.** No Postgres, no DuckDB, no Redis, no dedicated vector DB. Embeddings stored as BLOBs; cosine similarity in numpy.
- **HTMX + Jinja frontend.** No React/Vue/Svelte. No JavaScript build step. The UI template handed over from claude.ai/design will be ported into Jinja partials.
- **LLM split: Ollama local for per-item work, Anthropic API for synthesis only.** Do not introduce OpenAI, llama.cpp direct, or other providers.
- **scrapers-lib is an external Python dependency** at `..\scrapers-lib`. Use only `tier1` modules: `rss`, `reddit` (PRAW), `youtube`, `article`. Do not modify scrapers-lib from this project.
- **Personal-local only.** No auth, no TLS, no cloud, no multi-user. Listens on `localhost`.

## Session conventions

- Major decisions → append a dated entry in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- End of every working session → append to `docs/SESSION_LOG.md`: what was done, where we left off, what's blocked.
- Update `docs/TASKS.md` checkboxes as work moves.
- New unknowns / deferred items → `docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.

## Out of scope (deferred to "Later")

- Push delivery (email/Discord) — after core phases ship
- Multi-user, accounts, sharing
- Backfill of historical data — accept cold start
- Mobile-specific UI

## scrapers-lib at a glance

Located at `C:\Users\AW-testing\Downloads\Workspace\scrapers-lib`. Python lib. `tier1` provides RSS, Reddit (PRAW — official API), YouTube + transcripts, generic article extraction (justext). `core` provides rate limiting, caching, robots.txt, attribution, scheduler. `tier2/tier3` (laptop/retail) are unused for this project.
